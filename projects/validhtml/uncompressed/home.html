        <h2> About Us </h2>
          <p> Uncompressed is a source for you to get caught up on all of the things that pique your interests. We cover topics in-depth such as
              Technology, Science, Films, Books, Music, Graphic Novels, DIY projects/builds, and much more. Your storytellers and content providers
              are Michael Flores and Francisco Serrano who are both avid enthusiasts collectively off all aforementioned topics. Our content is delivered
              to you in the best forms which we believe are most accessible and beneficial to every lifetyle. Depending on the topics themselves there
              will be an article written, a video upload, a blog post, or quite possibly an entire podcast episode (which we think is the most entertaining). </p>

        <h2> How We Got Here </h2>
          <p> Michael and Francisco met in 2014 at their place of business in Orlando, FL. They were both Retail Sales Specialists at a local mobile carrier,
              and it is here where they grew to know each other and uncover all of the common (and not so common) interests that they shared. As they got to
              spend more time together and share their passions, they both realized that the thing they had in common most was that they were constanly the
              point person within their respective groups to be asked how something works, or if they could fix it. They were also the authority within their
              groups that were wells of useful (sometimes useless...mostly uselss) information and fun facts. One night they were sitting together and had just
              finished listening to an episode of their favourite podcast, and this is when a very important discussion began. A discussion about how well
              informed they liked to be, and how they love sharing that information with others. They then began brainstorming about the best ways to share their
              favourite content with their friends and family. How to make the seemingly overly techncial, fairly simplified to understand for everyone. And they
              wanted to do this in a way that would be fun, for both giving the content and for the ones receiving it. It was here where the Uncompressed podcast
              began its infancy, deciding that they would begin with a 10-episode run and reevaluate to see where they wanted to take it. Now here we are, ready
              to share with you all that we have been planning and scheming in the lab (our living room). We are <strong> really </strong> excited to have you
              here with us.</p>

        <h2> Our Vision </h2>
          <p> We want to take away the intimidation factor that these sometimes difficult to understand topics can have on everyone, and give you the power
            to be informed along with us. Be informed about the things you use, how they work, some hidden features and tricks; all to be added to your arsenal
            of knowledge, internet memes, and shows you binge-watched this past weekend. That's the first half of what we want you to get out of this, the other
            being more laid back. We want you to have fun with us, which is why we also provide a lot of entertainment content and things we hope you can geek
            out with us about. This is a safe (not necessarily safe for work all the time) environment for you to explore your inner nerd with us and become
            empowered with whatever you want to take away from our content. Last but not least, we love where we live in beautiful Orlando, FL. That being said
            there will also be plenty of local content about projects or events going on near us. We like to explore and have a blast, we only hope that you
            love the same things enough to join us.</p>
